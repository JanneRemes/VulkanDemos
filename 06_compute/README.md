Demo 06: Compute Shaders
========================

This demo shows how to use Vulkan's compute shaders, and how to use the computed data in some rendering operations.
A compute shader is used to implement a simulation of Conway's Game of Life; the results are then fetched from a fragment shader and used to update the display with a visual representation of the game.
